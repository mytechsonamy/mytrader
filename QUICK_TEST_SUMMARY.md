## Test Status: ✅ **PASS** (Backend) | ⏳ **MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED** (Frontend)

---

## What Was Tested

### ✅ Backend API (AUTOMATED - ALL PASS)
- Database population: **76 records** across **19 symbols** ✅
- Exchange filtering: **BIST (3), NASDAQ (5), NYSE (2), BINANCE (9)** ✅
- Field mapping: **market, venue, marketName** all present ✅
- Error handling: Invalid/empty parameters handled gracefully ✅
- Performance: All API calls < 50ms ✅

### ⏳ Frontend Dashboard (MANUAL VALIDATION NEEDED)
Open http://localhost:3000 and verify:
- [ ] BIST accordion shows 3 Turkish stocks
- [ ] NASDAQ accordion shows 5 US tech stocks
- [ ] NYSE accordion shows 2 stocks
- [ ] BINANCE accordion shows 9 cryptocurrencies
- [ ] All prices are numeric (not N/A)
- [ ] No browser console errors

## Critical Fix Applied

### Problem Discovered
The Docker container was running **outdated code from October 7**. All fixes implemented after that date were NOT deployed.

### Solution Applied
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache mytrader_api
docker-compose up -d mytrader_api
```

**Result**: All tests now pass ✅

## Quick Verification Commands

### Test BIST Filtering
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/symbols?exchange=BIST" | jq '.symbols | keys'
# Expected: ["GARAN", "SISE", "THYAO"]
```

### Test Field Mapping
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/symbols?exchange=BIST" | jq '.symbols.GARAN | {market, venue, marketName}'
# Expected: All fields = "BIST"
```

### Test All Exchanges
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/symbols?exchange=NASDAQ" | jq '.symbols | length'  # Expected: 5
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/symbols?exchange=NYSE" | jq '.symbols | length'    # Expected: 2
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/symbols?exchange=BINANCE" | jq '.symbols | length' # Expected: 9

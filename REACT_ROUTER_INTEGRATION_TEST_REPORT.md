### 2. Authentication Flow Integration

#### 2.1 Authentication Store Integration ✅ PASS
**Test Coverage:** Zustand authentication state management

**Frontend Authentication Flow:**
```
Guest State → Login Attempt → Token Storage → Authenticated State
     ↓             ↓              ↓              ↓
Public Pages → Login Form → localStorage → Protected Access
```

**Key Validations:**
- ✅ Guest mode allows public page access
- ✅ Login form renders correctly at `/login`
- ✅ Authentication state persists across page refreshes
- ✅ Protected routes become accessible after authentication
- ✅ Logout functionality clears state and redirects appropriately

#### 2.2 Route Preservation ✅ PASS
**Test Scenario:** User attempts to access `/portfolio` → redirected to `/login` → after login, redirected back to `/portfolio`

- ✅ **Original Route Captured**: `/portfolio` stored in navigation state
- ✅ **Login Redirect**: User sent to `/login` page
- ✅ **Post-Login Redirect**: User returned to original `/portfolio` route
- ✅ **State Consistency**: No data loss during redirect chain

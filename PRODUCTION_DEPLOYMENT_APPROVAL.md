## ‚ö†Ô∏è **KNOWN ISSUES & MITIGATION**

### **Non-Critical Issues (Monitored)**
1. **Volume Leaders Endpoint**: Returns HTTP 500 error
   - **Impact**: Low - alternative endpoints available
   - **Mitigation**: Fallback to symbols list, documented in operations guide
   - **Timeline**: Fix scheduled for next maintenance window

2. **Health Check Service**: Requires restart to fully activate
   - **Impact**: Low - core health endpoint functional
   - **Mitigation**: Will be resolved during production deployment restart
   - **Status**: Fix already implemented, awaits deployment

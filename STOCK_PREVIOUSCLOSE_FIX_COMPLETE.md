# Stock Data Previous Close Fix - Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Backend Ready for Testing
**Scope**: BIST, NASDAQ, NYSE stock data only (Binance crypto unchanged)

---

## Problem Summary

The mobile app was displaying stock data without "Önceki Kapanış" (Previous Close) information, and the percentage change was showing the change amount instead of the actual percentage.

**Issues**:
1. Previous Close field not displayed in mobile UI
2. Percentage calculation incorrect - showing change amount labeled as percentage
3. Affects BIST, NASDAQ, and NYSE stock markets only (Binance crypto was working correctly)

---

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes ✅

All backend changes have been implemented and deployed:

1. **YahooFinanceProvider.cs** (Lines 164-170)
   - ✅ Correctly fetches `PreviousClose` from Yahoo Finance API
   - ✅ Calculates percentage using standard financial formula: `((Current - PreviousClose) / PreviousClose) × 100`
   - ✅ Stores `priceChangePercent` correctly

2. **YahooFinancePollingService.cs** (Line 171)
   - ✅ Maps `PreviousClose` from Yahoo provider to `StockPriceData`
   - ✅ Broadcasts price updates with `PreviousClose` included
   - ✅ Polling 10 stock symbols every 60 seconds

3. **MultiAssetDataBroadcastService.cs** (Lines 57, 98)
   - ✅ Broadcasts stock updates with `PreviousClose` field populated
   - ✅ Uses `PriceChangePercent` (percentage) not `PriceChange` (amount) for `Change24h`

### Frontend Changes ✅

All frontend changes have been implemented:

1. **PriceContext.tsx** (Lines 154, 168, 247)
   - ✅ Maps both `previousClose` (camelCase) and `PreviousClose` (PascalCase) from WebSocket
   - ✅ Normalizes data for mobile app consumption

2. **AssetCard.tsx**
   - ✅ Compact view (Lines 213-216): Displays "Önc: $X.XX"
   - ✅ Full view (Lines 318-323): Displays "Önceki Kapanış: $X.XX"
   - ✅ Conditional rendering - only shows when `previousClose` is available

3. **TypeScript Types** (types/index.ts:252)
   - ✅ `UnifiedMarketDataDto` interface includes `previousClose?: number`

### Recent Polling Cycles
```
[15:43:21] Starting stock data polling cycle 7
[15:43:21] Polling BIST market via Yahoo Finance
[15:43:21] Polling NASDAQ market via Yahoo Finance
[15:43:21] Polling NYSE market via Yahoo Finance
[15:43:22] Completed polling cycle 7 - Success: 7, Failed: 0
```

## Data Flow Verification

### Complete Path ✅
1. **Yahoo Finance API** → Returns stock data with `PreviousClose` and current `Price`
2. **YahooFinanceProvider** → Extracts values, calculates percentage correctly
3. **YahooFinancePollingService** → Maps to `StockPriceData` with `PreviousClose`
4. **Event Fire** → `StockPriceUpdated?.Invoke(priceUpdate)`
5. **MultiAssetDataBroadcastService** → Subscribes to event, broadcasts via SignalR
6. **SignalR Hub** → Sends `MultiAssetPriceUpdate` messages to mobile clients
7. **Mobile WebSocket** → Receives messages in `PriceContext`
8. **PriceContext** → Normalizes and stores in state with `previousClose`
9. **AssetCard** → Renders "Önceki Kapanış" field when available

## Verification Code Snippets

### Backend: Broadcasting PreviousClose
```csharp
// MultiAssetDataBroadcastService.cs:57
var update = new MultiAssetPriceUpdate
{
    Symbol = stockUpdate.Symbol,
    AssetClass = stockUpdate.AssetClass,
    Price = stockUpdate.Price,
    Change24h = stockUpdate.PriceChangePercent, // ✅ FIXED: Percent not amount
    PreviousClose = stockUpdate.PreviousClose,   // ✅ Added for frontend
    // ... other fields
};
```

### Frontend: Displaying Previous Close
```typescript
// AssetCard.tsx:318-323 (Full View)
{marketData.previousClose !== undefined && marketData.previousClose !== null && (
  <View style={styles.previousCloseContainer}>
    <Text style={styles.previousCloseLabel}>Önceki Kapanış:</Text>
    <Text style={styles.previousCloseValue}>
      {formatPrice(marketData.previousClose, true)}
    </Text>
  </View>
)}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Restart Mobile Application
The backend is ready and broadcasting data with `PreviousClose`. To see the changes:

```bash
# In your mobile terminal
cd frontend/mobile
npx expo start --clear
# Then press 'i' for iOS or 'a' for Android
```

### Step 2: Verify on Dashboard Screen
1. Navigate to the Dashboard screen
2. Look at the stock symbols (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, etc.)
3. **Compact View**: You should see "Önc: $XXX.XX" below the price
4. **Full View** (if expanded): You should see "Önceki Kapanış: $XXX.XX" as a separate row

### Step 3: Check Percentage Values
1. The percentage change (e.g., "+1.5%" or "-2.3%") should now be correct
2. Formula used: `((Current Price - Previous Close) / Previous Close) × 100`
3. Example: If previous close was $250 and current is $253, percentage should show +1.20%

### Step 4: Verify Real-Time Updates
1. Keep the Dashboard screen open
2. Every 60 seconds, the backend polls Yahoo Finance
3. You should see the prices and percentages update in real-time
4. Previous Close values should remain stable (only updates daily)

## Expected Results

### ✅ Success Criteria
- [x] Backend compiles and runs without errors
- [x] Stock data polling works (BIST, NASDAQ, NYSE)
- [x] SignalR broadcasting includes `PreviousClose` field
- [x] Mobile frontend receives WebSocket messages
- [x] Mobile UI components ready to display Previous Close

### Visual Example (Expected)
```
╔════════════════════════════════╗
║ AAPL (NASDAQ) - STOCK         ║
║ $254.04            +1.56% ↑   ║
║ Önc: $250.15                  ║  ← This should now appear
╚════════════════════════════════╝
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Previous Close not showing after restart
**Check**:
1. Backend is running on port 5002: `curl http://localhost:5002/api/health`
2. WebSocket connection active in mobile console logs
3. Data format in console: Look for `previousClose` or `PreviousClose` field

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check backend logs
cd backend/MyTrader.Api
dotnet run
# Look for: "Broadcasting stock update" messages with PreviousClose
```

### Issue: Percentage still looks wrong
**Check**:
1. Compare displayed percentage with manual calculation
2. Formula: `((Current - PreviousClose) / PreviousClose) × 100`
3. Backend logs should show correct values

**Debug**:
```bash
# Test API directly
curl http://localhost:5002/api/dashboard/overview | grep -A 10 "AAPL"
# Should show previousClose and correct percentages
```

### Issue: Only showing for some stocks
**Check**:
1. Yahoo Finance API returns PreviousClose for that symbol
2. Market is open or has recent data
3. Backend logs show successful polling for that specific symbol

## Technical Notes

### PascalCase vs camelCase Handling
The frontend correctly handles both naming conventions:
```typescript
previousClose: data.previousClose || data.PreviousClose
```

This ensures compatibility with:
- Backend SignalR messages (PascalCase: `PreviousClose`)
- JSON serialization variations (camelCase: `previousClose`)

### Why Previous Close Might Be Null
- **Market Closed**: Some stocks may not have PreviousClose during extended hours
- **API Limitation**: Yahoo Finance occasionally doesn't provide PreviousClose for certain symbols
- **New Symbol**: Newly added symbols might not have historical data yet

The UI correctly handles this by conditionally rendering the field only when available.

# QUICK FIX: Mobile App Connection Restored

## What Was Wrong
Your mobile app was trying to connect to port **5002**, but the backend is running on port **8080**.

## What I Fixed
Updated 3 configuration files to use the correct port (8080):
- `frontend/mobile/app.json`
- `frontend/mobile/src/config.ts`
- `frontend/mobile/src/services/websocketService.ts`

## What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Restart the Mobile App

In your terminal where Expo is running:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the Metro bundler
2. Run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/mobile
   npm start -- --clear
   ```
3. Press `i` for iOS or `a` for Android

### Step 2: Verify It's Working

After the app reloads, check the console logs. You should see:

**GOOD SIGNS** ✓:
```
Config Debug - API_BASE_URL: http://192.168.68.102:8080/api
SignalR connection established
```

**BAD SIGNS** ✗ (means cache didn't clear):
```
Config Debug - API_BASE_URL: http://192.168.68.102:5002/api
Failed to complete negotiation
```

If you see bad signs, run:
```bash
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

### Step 3: Test the App

1. **Login**: Should work with your credentials
2. **Dashboard**: Should show real prices (not "--")
3. **Market Data**: All sections should have data

## If Still Not Working

Try a full cache clear:
```bash
cd frontend/mobile
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

Or verify backend is running:
```bash
docker ps | grep mytrader_api
# Should show: 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp

curl http://192.168.68.102:8080/api/health
# Should return: {"isHealthy":true}
```

## Why This Happened

The backend port was changed to 8080, but the mobile app configuration wasn't updated. Now all configs point to the correct port.

**TL;DR**: Restart mobile app with `npm start -- --clear` and everything should work.

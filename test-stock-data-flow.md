# Stock Data Flow Validation Test

## Testing Instructions

After the fix has been applied, follow these steps to validate stock data is flowing correctly.

---

## Fix Applied

### File: `frontend/mobile/src/context/PriceContext.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ Added case-insensitive field name handling (Symbol vs symbol)
2. ‚úÖ Enhanced logging to show all field names received
3. ‚úÖ Added specific logging for STOCK asset class updates
4. ‚úÖ Applied fixes to both `price_update` and `batch_price_update` handlers

**Key Improvements:**
```typescript
// Now handles both cases:
const rawSymbol = data.symbol || data.Symbol;
const rawAssetClass = data.assetClass || data.AssetClass || 'CRYPTO';
const rawPrice = data.price || data.Price;
```

---

## Validation Steps

### Step 1: Start Backend (if not already running)

```bash
cd backend/MyTrader.Api
dotnet run
```

**Expected output:**
```
Now listening on: http://192.168.68.102:5002
```

### Step 2: Verify Backend is Broadcasting Stock Prices

Watch backend logs for stock price broadcasts:

```bash
# Look for these log messages:
Broadcasting price update: STOCK AAPL = 258.06
Broadcasting price update: STOCK MSFT = 450.50
Successfully broadcasted price update for AAPL to X groups
```

‚úÖ If you see these messages, backend is working correctly.

---

### Step 3: Start Mobile App

```bash
cd frontend/mobile
npm start
# Or
npx expo start
```

---

### Step 4: Open Developer Console

In Expo Developer Tools or Metro Bundler, open the console/logs.

---

### Step 5: Watch for Connection Messages

Look for these log messages in order:

```
1. [PriceContext] Initializing WebSocket connection...
2. SignalR connection established
3. [PriceContext] Connection status changed: connected
4. [PriceContext] Fetching symbols and subscribing...
5. [PriceContext] Loaded X crypto symbols: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, ...
6. [PriceContext] Loaded X stock symbols: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, ...
7. [PriceContext] Subscribing to CRYPTO symbols: [...]
8. [PriceContext] Successfully subscribed to CRYPTO price updates
9. [PriceContext] Subscribing to STOCK symbols: [...]
10. [PriceContext] Successfully subscribed to STOCK price updates
```

‚úÖ If all these appear, WebSocket connection and subscription is working.

---

### Step 6: Watch for Price Update Messages

Within 60 seconds (backend polls every 60s), you should see:

```javascript
// For each stock price update:
[PriceContext] RAW price_update - All fields: ['Type', 'AssetClass', 'Symbol', 'Price', 'Change24h', 'Volume', ...]
[PriceContext] RAW price_update: {
  symbol: 'AAPL',
  assetClass: 'STOCK',
  price: 258.06,
  volume: 50000000,
  ...
}
[PriceContext] Normalized price_update: {
  symbolId: 'AAPL',
  symbol: 'AAPL',
  assetClass: 'STOCK',
  price: 258.06,
  ...
}
[PriceContext] ‚úÖ Stock price updated: AAPL = $258.06
```

‚úÖ If you see these messages with `assetClass: 'STOCK'`, price updates are being received!

---

### Step 7: Verify State Updates

Look for:

```
[PriceContext] enhancedPrices state updated: 15 items
[PriceContext] Sample prices: [
  { id: 'BTCUSDT', symbol: 'BTCUSDT', price: 45000 },
  { id: 'ETHUSDT', symbol: 'ETHUSDT', price: 3500 },
  { id: 'AAPL', symbol: 'AAPL', price: 258.06 }  // ‚úÖ Stock data!
]
```

‚úÖ If you see stock symbols (AAPL, MSFT, etc.) in the sample prices, state is being updated correctly!

---

### Step 8: Check Dashboard Screen

Look for these log messages from DashboardScreen:

```
[Dashboard] Loaded 10 total stock symbols
[Dashboard] Filtered stocks - BIST: 0, NASDAQ: 5, NYSE: 5
```

‚úÖ If symbols are being filtered correctly, dashboard is processing stock data.

---

### Step 9: Visual Verification in App

1. Navigate to Dashboard screen in the mobile app
2. Look for these sections:
   - üöÄ Kripto (should show crypto prices)
   - üè¢ BIST Hisseleri (should show BIST stocks if available)
   - üá∫üá∏ NASDAQ Hisseleri (should show NASDAQ stocks)
   - üóΩ NYSE Hisseleri (should show NYSE stocks)

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Sections expand/collapse when tapped
   - Stock symbols appear with names (e.g., "AAPL - Apple Inc.")
   - Prices are displayed (e.g., "$258.06")
   - Percent change is shown with color (green for positive, red for negative)
   - Volume is formatted (e.g., "50.0M")

4. **NO MORE "Veri yok" message** for stock sections with data!

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No Stock Symbols Loaded

**Symptom:**
```
[PriceContext] Loaded 0 stock symbols:
```

**Fix:**
Check API response manually:
```bash
curl "http://192.168.68.102:5002/api/symbol-preferences/defaults?assetClass=STOCK" | jq '.'
```

Expected response should include `market` or `marketName` field for each symbol.

---

### Issue 2: Symbols Loaded But No Price Updates

**Symptom:**
```
[PriceContext] Loaded 10 stock symbols: AAPL, MSFT, ...
[PriceContext] Successfully subscribed to STOCK price updates
# But no "RAW price_update" messages for stocks
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check backend is broadcasting:
   ```bash
   # Backend logs should show:
   Broadcasting price update: STOCK AAPL = 258.06
   ```

2. If backend is broadcasting but frontend not receiving:
   - Verify SignalR hub connection is established
   - Check for WebSocket errors in console
   - Restart mobile app

---

### Issue 3: Symbols All Filtered Out (Empty Sections)

**Symptom:**
```
[Dashboard] Loaded 10 total stock symbols
[Dashboard] Filtered stocks - BIST: 0, NASDAQ: 0, NYSE: 0
```

**Diagnosis:**
Check if `marketName` field is populated:

Add temporary logging to DashboardScreen.tsx before line 205:
```typescript
console.log('Stock symbols with markets:', allStocks.map(s => ({
  symbol: s.symbol,
  marketName: s.marketName,
  market: (s as any).market
})));
```

**Fix:**
If `marketName` is undefined, the API response doesn't include the field. Contact backend team to add `market` or `marketName` field to symbol response.

---

### Issue 4: Field Names Still Not Matching

**Symptom:**
```
[PriceContext] RAW price_update - All fields: ['unknownField1', 'unknownField2', ...]
```

**Fix:**
1. Copy the exact field names from the log
2. Update PriceContext.tsx to handle those specific field names
3. Report field names to team for backend standardization

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **All checks passed if:**

1. Backend logs show: "Broadcasting price update: STOCK AAPL = $258.06"
2. Frontend logs show: "[PriceContext] Loaded 10 stock symbols"
3. Frontend logs show: "[PriceContext] ‚úÖ Stock price updated: AAPL = $258.06"
4. Frontend logs show: "[PriceContext] enhancedPrices state updated: 15 items" (crypto + stocks)
5. Dashboard shows stock symbols with prices (NO "Veri yok")
6. Prices update automatically every 60 seconds

---

## Performance Monitoring

Expected update frequency:
- **Crypto**: Real-time (multiple updates per second via Binance WebSocket)
- **Stocks**: Every 60 seconds (Yahoo Finance polling)

Monitor for:
- Memory usage (should be stable)
- Console log volume (should be reasonable)
- UI responsiveness (should remain smooth)

---

## Next Steps After Validation

1. ‚úÖ If stock data appears: **SUCCESS!** Fix is working.
2. ‚ùå If still not working: Collect logs and diagnostic info:
   - Full console log output
   - Backend log output
   - API response from `/api/symbol-preferences/defaults?assetClass=STOCK`
   - Screenshot of dashboard

3. Consider enabling database writes (currently disabled):
   - Add `asset_class` column to `market_data` table
   - Enable line 190 in `YahooFinancePollingService.cs`
   - This will persist stock prices to database

---

## Database Persistence (Optional Next Step)

Currently database writes are DISABLED. To enable:

### Migration Required:
```sql
ALTER TABLE market_data
ADD COLUMN asset_class VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'CRYPTO';

CREATE INDEX idx_market_data_asset_class ON market_data(asset_class);
```

### Enable Writes:
File: `backend/MyTrader.Services/Market/YahooFinancePollingService.cs` line 188-190

Change:
```csharp
// NOTE: Database save disabled
// await SaveToMarketDataTableAsync(priceUpdate, dbContext, cancellationToken);
```

To:
```csharp
await SaveToMarketDataTableAsync(priceUpdate, dbContext, cancellationToken);
```

# Platform Stabilization Requirements

## Introduction

MyTrader platformunda mevcut temel fonksiyonların stabil çalışması için kritik sorunların çözülmesi gerekiyor. Platform şu anda test aşamasında ancak database bağlantı sorunları, Binance WebSocket bağlantısının kararsızlığı ve frontend'de market verilerinin karışması gibi temel sorunlar nedeniyle stabil çalışmıyor.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Bağlantı Stabilitesi

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database connections to be stable and reliable, so that the platform can operate without data access interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the database connection SHALL be established successfully within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a database query fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times
3. WHEN database connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect within 60 seconds
4. WHEN EF Core migrations are pending THEN they SHALL be applied automatically on startup
5. IF database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with cached data where possible

### Requirement 2: Binance WebSocket Bağlantı Stabilitesi

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time price data from Binance to be consistently available, so that I can make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Binance WebSocket connection is established THEN it SHALL remain connected for at least 95% uptime
2. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect within 10 seconds
3. WHEN reconnection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s max)
4. WHEN price data is received THEN it SHALL be processed and distributed to clients within 100ms
5. IF connection fails after 5 retry attempts THEN the system SHALL wait 5 minutes before attempting recovery
6. WHEN WebSocket is healthy THEN it SHALL send heartbeat pings every 30 seconds

### Requirement 3: Market Data Ayrımı ve Organizasyonu

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see market data organized by exchange/market (NASDAQ, NYSE, BIST, Binance), so that I can easily find and track specific assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market data is displayed THEN it SHALL be separated into distinct sections for each market (NASDAQ, NYSE, BIST, Binance)
2. WHEN a price update is received THEN it SHALL be routed to the correct market section based on asset class
3. WHEN user subscribes to market data THEN they SHALL be able to select specific markets to follow
4. IF market data contains mixed asset classes THEN it SHALL be automatically categorized by the system
5. WHEN displaying market sections THEN each SHALL show market status (open/closed) and last update time

### Requirement 4: SignalR Hub Koordinasyonu

**User Story:** As a developer, I want SignalR hubs to work in coordination without conflicts, so that real-time data flows correctly to frontend clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple hubs are active THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's message routing
2. WHEN a client connects THEN they SHALL be automatically subscribed to appropriate groups based on their preferences
3. WHEN price data is broadcast THEN it SHALL be sent through the correct hub (MarketDataHub for prices, TradingHub for signals)
4. IF a hub connection fails THEN other hubs SHALL continue operating normally
5. WHEN client disconnects THEN all their subscriptions SHALL be cleaned up automatically

### Requirement 5: Frontend Market Data Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see market data in organized accordion sections, so that I can easily navigate between different markets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display separate accordion sections for NASDAQ, NYSE, BIST, and Binance
2. WHEN market data updates THEN it SHALL appear in the correct accordion section
3. WHEN an accordion is expanded THEN it SHALL show symbols specific to that market
4. IF no data is available for a market THEN the accordion SHALL show "No data available" message
5. WHEN market is closed THEN the accordion header SHALL indicate market status

### Requirement 6: Error Handling ve Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error logging and graceful error handling, so that I can diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN it SHALL be logged with appropriate severity level and context
2. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with connection string details (without credentials)
3. WHEN WebSocket errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with connection state and retry information
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL continue operating in degraded mode where possible
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN recovery SHALL be logged with performance metrics

### Requirement 7: Performance ve Memory Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to use resources efficiently, so that it can run stably for extended periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing price updates THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 500MB baseline + 50MB per 1000 symbols
2. WHEN WebSocket connections are idle THEN they SHALL not consume more than 10MB memory each
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL complete within 5 seconds or timeout gracefully
4. IF memory usage exceeds 1GB THEN the system SHALL trigger garbage collection and log memory statistics
5. WHEN system runs for 24+ hours THEN performance SHALL not degrade by more than 10%
